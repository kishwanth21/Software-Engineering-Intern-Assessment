# Software-Engineering-Intern-Assessment

## Introduction
This project is a simple FastAPI web application that provides a basic login functionality using a MySQL database. It allows users to enter their username and password and checks if the provided credentials match any entry in the MySQL database. If the credentials are valid, it returns a "Login successful" message; otherwise, it raises an HTTP 401 "Invalid credentials" error. <br>
